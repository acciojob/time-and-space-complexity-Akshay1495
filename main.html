	<h1>Time, Space, and Complexity.</h1>
	<p>Time complexity refers to the measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the length of its input. It's a critical concept in computer science, aiding in the evaluation of algorithm efficiency. Time complexity analysis helps determine how an algorithm scales with input size, enabling us to predict its performance as data grows. Algorithms with lower time complexity are deemed more efficient as they complete tasks in less time, making them preferable in most scenarios where speed is crucial.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> often denoted as O(n), assesses the amount of memory an algorithm requires relative to the input size. It measures the maximum memory needed during execution. Algorithms with lower space complexity are preferred as they consume less memory, critical in resource-constrained environments or with large datasets. Efficient algorithms strike a balance between time and space complexity for optimal performance.</p>
